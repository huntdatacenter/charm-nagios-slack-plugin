This subordinate charm enables [Nagios][nagios] to send notifications to [Slack][slack].
The charm is intended to be used with the [`nagios`][nagios-charm] charm.

## Usage

The charm creates a new Nagios contact definition called `slack`.
This contact should be added to the default Nagios contact group.
Here is an example to get going:

```
juju deploy cs:~huntdatacenter/nagios-slack-plugin
juju deploy nagios
juju add-relation nagios:juju-info nagios-slack-plugin:juju-info
juju config nagios contactgroup-members="root,slack"
```
